        "\n",
        "Ans-Python parameters allow functions to receive values from a function call.\n",
        "2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate).\n",
        "A negative correlation, also known as an inverse correlation, means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, improving their performance over time through experience. The main components are data, algorithms, models, and predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A model's loss value, which quantifies the difference between its predictions and actual values, helps determine how well the model is performing and guides its improvement during training; a lower loss generally indicates a better-performing model.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- continuous variables can take any value within a range (like height or weight), while categorical variables represent distinct groups or categories (like gender or color).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- To handle categorical variables in machine learning, you need to convert them into a numerical format that algorithms can understand. Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, ordinal encoding, and target encoding, each suited for different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-In machine learning, \"training a dataset\" means using a portion of your data to teach a model to recognize patterns and make predictions, while \"testing a dataset\" means evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In the context of Python's scikit-learn library, preprocessing refers to the process of transforming raw data into a format that is more suitable for machine learning algorithms, often involving techniques like scaling, normalization, and handling missing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In machine learning, a test set is a portion of the data that is withheld during model training and used solely to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after it has been trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python? How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- To split data for model fitting, training, and testing in Python, use the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library, specifying the data, target, and desired test size (e.g., 20% or 25%).\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Explain the dataset and the problem · 2. Descriptive analytics · 3. Checking for Missing values · 4. Outlier detection · 5. EDA — Feature ...\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before model fitting is crucial because it helps identify data quality issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies), understand data structure and relationships, and informs data cleaning and feature selection, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable models.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A negative correlation, also known as an inverse correlation, means that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- To use the corrcoef() function, you need to pass in two arrays of data, one for each variable. The function will return a correlation matrix, which is a square matrix where the diagonal elements are always 1 and the off-diagonal elements indicate the correlations between different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Causation means one event directly results in another, while correlation simply indicates a relationship between two events, where one doesn't necessarily cause the other. For example, while ice cream sales and shark attacks might be correlated (both increase during summer), ice cream sales do not cause shark attacks, but rather both are influenced by the third variable: sunny weather.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Optimizers are algorithms that update model parameters (like weights and biases) to minimize a loss function during training. Common types include Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and adaptive optimizers like Adam and RMSprop, each with varying strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "1.Gradient Descent:\n",
        "Concept:\n",
        "Iteratively adjusts model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function, aiming to find the minimum.\n",

        "18. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Model fitting is a procedure that takes three steps: First you need a function that takes in a set of parameters and returns a predicted data set. Second you need an 'error function' that provides a number representing the difference between your data and the model's prediction for any given set of model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Model. predict passes the input vector through the model and returns the output tensor for each datapoint. Since the last layer in your model is a single Dense neuron, the output for any datapoint is a single value.\n",

        "\n",
        "22. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The Python sklearn module has a method called StandardScaler() which returns a Scaler object with methods for transforming data sets.\n",

        "23. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In the context of scikit-learn (sklearn), \"preprocessing\" refers to the process of transforming raw data into a format that is more suitable for machine learning algorithms, using utility functions and transformer classes within the sklearn.preprocessing module.\n",
